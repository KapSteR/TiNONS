\section*{Discussion}
This section contains a brief discussion of the results of the five different classification methods which have been used throughout this project.

In this project the speaker base only contain three people and are therefore fairly limited. 
Some of the models that was used to classify the data may not work with different speakers or a large group of speakers.
To make the models more robust are large base of speakers is needed.
For some of the models three speakers base is already at the limited of the computer power and  available.
