\section*{Conclusion}
In this project five classification methods were used for speaker recognition.
The dataset consisted of three different speakers, saying the digits 0-9, divided onto three datasets.
One with one digits, one with two digigts and one with ten digits expressed.\\

The different methods was implemented through MATLAB and compared using the confusion matrix and the overall accuracy.
The result is that we can determine who is speaking it is down to 95.3 \% for one digit and 89.4 \% for ten digits.
The model that gave the best result was the Artificial Neaural Networks with Gaussian Mixture Models as a close contender.
