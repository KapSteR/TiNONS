\section*{Conclusion}
In this project five classification methods was used as speaker recognition.
The dataset consist of three different speakers, expressing the digit 0-9, divided onto thee dataset, one, two or ten digits expressed.\\

The different methods was implemented through MATLAB and compared using the confusion matrix and the overall accuracy. The result is that we can determined which speaker it is down to 95.3 \% for one digit and 89.4 \% for ten digits. The model that gave the best result was the ANN and very close with the GMM.
