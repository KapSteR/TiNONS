\begin{equation}
t_{new} = 
\mathtt{sign}\left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} \alpha_n t_n k(\mathbf{x}_n,\mathbf{x}_{new}) +b  \right)
\end{equation}
with $ k = \mathtt{exp}(-\gamma \|\mathbf{x}^T_n - \mathbf{x}_{new} \|^2 ) $

\paragraph*{Result}
The result was obtained by using a Gaussian kernel, and the classification accuracy was found to be 73.7 \% for the one digit dataset after training on the training set and afterwards classifying the test set.
