\chapter{Features}

When doing speaker recognition it is advantageous to classify on the basis of extracted features from speech data, rather than the audio samples themselves. \ref{} % Reference

In this project, the features used for classification are based on Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC).
They have proven effective for use in speaker recognition, in other implementations. \ref{} % Reference

\section{Feature extraction}

The extraction of MFCC features from audio samples is done in MATLAB, using an open-source toolbox called Voicebox.
