\chapter{K-means clustering}
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for finding sub populations in unlabelled data.
It basically works by iteratively estimating K cluster means and assigning responsibility according to euclidean distance.

\section{The K-means algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}

\item
Choose the number, K, of clusters to fit.

\item
Pick K random guesses of mean values, or mean vector for multi dimensional data.


\end{enumerate}


In project like this K-means could used to make a sort of mixture model of each speaker, by fitting a number of clusters to the different unique sounds the individual speaker makes and then for a series of samples evaluating which speaker is most likely to have emitted the sounds.
