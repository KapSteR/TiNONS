\section{Description}
The data that we use to test individual classification methods in this project consists of recordings from 4 speakers repeatedly saying the numbers 0 through nine.
From this set one speaker was removed, because significantly fewer recordings ware made of this.
Hence the amount of data points less fewer than was desired.

Out of the dataset, 15 utterings of each digit ware selected randomly from each speaker, classified and put into the training set.
Another 5 utterings of each digit from each speaker was then classified ad selected as test set.

The data is sampled at $ 48\ kHz, 16\frac{bits}{sample}  $

The data is provided by \cite{DataSet}
