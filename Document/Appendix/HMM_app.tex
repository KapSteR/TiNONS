\chapter{Hidden Markov Models}
In this project the Hidden Markov models (HMM) is not used on the data.
The reason for this is that the HMM is optimized for recognizing the sequence of the sounds which combines to a word.
HMM is focused on speech recognition and not speaker recognition, which is this project works with.

\section{Theory}   
The HMM is developed to process sequential information in the data, in other models the features have been treated as independent and identical distribution.
When classifying speech from a sequence of data recorded over time, the features tend to be strongly associate with the previous features.
The associated features can be exploited by the HMM to classify.
