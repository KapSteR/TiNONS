\chapter{Probabilistic Generative Models}
In this part of the appendix, describes the Probabilistic Generative models (PGM) and how it is used on the dataset.

\section{Theory} 
The model is a multivariate normal distribution, which means that each class corresponds to a unique distribution.
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{x}|C_k)=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\mu}_k, \; \Sigma_k)
\end{equation}
