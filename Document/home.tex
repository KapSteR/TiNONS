% A file like this(called home.tex) could be placed in each latex project folder. 

% This will give the possibility to use modules like this:
% \input{home} - This is needed to use the \home command
% \input{\home/Modules/Usepackages}
% \input{\home/Modules/ChapterStyle}
% \input{\home/Modules/HeaderAndFooter}

% If you use Github or any other collaborating tool, you should ignore the home.tex file, so that every user could have their own home.tex file.

\newcommand{\home}{C:/Users/Kasper/Documents/GitHub/Latex}
